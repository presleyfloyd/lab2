        <h2> about me </h2>
                <p> Hi, my name is Presley Floyd. I'm from Massachusetts, and I'm a sophomore at Lesley University, majoring in graphic design because I love being creative. I hope to use design as a tool to do good, to "Make a Difference <em>and</em> Make a living"- Noah Scalin. I love typography; I want to create type that is both beautiful and meaningful.</p>

            <img src="Presley_floyd_Alphabet copy.jpg" alt=" cursive alphabet with different flowers on each letter" >
                <p>This was a project I did for Type 1, where we had to create our own alphabet. I chose to base mine on cursive writing, and for each letter, I drew a flower whose name started with that letter.</p>

                <p> This is a project I am currently working on in Type Two. We are making beer posters, and I really love the way I manipulated the type in this.</p>

                <p>I took this photo while I was learning to use my Canon camera, and I love the variety of colors in it. I used it as part of my monogram.</p>
